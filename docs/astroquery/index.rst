AstroQuery
==========

This is the documentation for the AstroQuery affiliated package of astropy.

AstroQuery is a set of tools for querying astronomical web forms and databases.

The :ref:`API <api.rst>` is intended to be kept as consistent as possible, such
that any web service can be used with a minimal learning curve imposed on the
user.

The following modules have been completed using a common API:

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  simbad.rst
  vizier.rst
  irsa_dust.rst

These others are functional, but do not follow a common & consistent API:


.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  irsa.rst
  ukidss.rst
  magpis.rst
  nrao.rst
  besancon.rst
  ned.rst
  nist.rst

  alfalfa.rst
  sha.rst
